The category Grpd of (small) groupoids, as needed for the groupoid model of HoTT.

Here is Hofmann and Streicher's original paper:
https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/HofmannStreicherGroupoidInterpretation.pdf

Here's something from the nLab that looks useful:
Ethan Lewis, Max Bohnet, The groupoid model of type theory, seminar notes (2017)

# The category Grpd of groupoids
Need at least the following, some of which is already in MathLib:
  - the category of small groupoids and their homomorphisms
  - (discrete and split) fibrations of groupoids
  - pullbacks of (discrete and split) fibrations exist in Grpd and are again (such) fibrations
  - set- and groupoid-valued presheaves on groupoids
  - the Grothendieck construction relating the previous two
  - the equivalence between (split) fibrations and presheaves of groupoids
  - Σ and Π-types for (split) fibrations
  - path groupoids
  - the universe of (small) discrete groupoids (aka sets)
  - polynomial functors of groupoids
  - maybe some W-types
  - eventually we will want some groupoid quotients as well
