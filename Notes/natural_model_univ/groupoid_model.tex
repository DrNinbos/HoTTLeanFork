% \subsection{Overview}

In this section we construct a natural model in $\Pshgrpd$ the presheaf category
indexed by the category $\grpd$ of (small) groupoids.
We will build the classifier for display maps in the style of
Hofmann and Streicher \cite{hofmannstreicher1996} and Awodey \cite{awodey2023hofmannstreicheruniverses}.
To interpret the type constructors,
we will make use of the weak factorization system on $\grpd$ -
which comes from restricting the ``classical Quillen model structure'' on
$\cat$ \cite{joyalnlabmodelstructuresoncat} to $\grpd$.

\medskip

\begin{notation*}
  We will have two universe sizes - one small and one large.
  We denote the category of small sets as $\set$ and the large sets as $\Set$
  (in the previous sections this would have been $\Set_{\lambda}$ and $\Set$ respectively).
  We denote the category of small categories as $\cat$ and the large categories as $\Cat$.
  We denote the category of small groupoids as $\grpd$. %% and the large groupoids as $\GRPD$.
  The category of small pointed groupoids will be $\grpd_{\bullet}$.

  We are primarily working in the category of large presheaves indexed by small groupoids,
  which we will denote by
  \[ \Pshgrpd = [\grpd^{\op}, \Set]\]

  In this section, $\Term$ and $\Type$ and so on will refer to the natural model semantics in this
  specific model.
\end{notation*}

\medskip

\begin{defn}[The disply map classifier]
  We would like to define a natural transformation in
  $\Pshgrpd$
  \[ \tp \co \Term \to \Type \]
  with representable fibers.

  Consider the functor that forgets the point
  \[
    U \co \ptgrpd \to \grpd
    \quad \quad
    \text{
      in \quad $\Cat$.
    }
  \]
  If we apply the yoneda embedding $y \co \Cat \to \PshCat$ to $U$
  we obtain
  \[ U \circ \co [ - , \ptgrpd] \to [ - , \grpd ]
    \quad \quad
    \text{
      in \quad $\PshCat$.
    }
  \]
  Since any small groupoid is also a large category $\grpd \hookrightarrow \Cat$,
  we can restrict $\Cat$ indexed presheaves to be $\grpd$ indexed presheaves.
  We define $\tp \co \Term \to \Type$ as the image of $U \circ$ under this restriction.
