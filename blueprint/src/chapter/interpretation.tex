%% Interpretation of Syntax into a specified Natural Model

%% This natural model should have

% - N universes and lifts (so N+1 natural models)
% - Pi types and Sigma types across all N+1 natural models
% - Identity types in every natural model,
%   such that the smallest universe's Identity type satisfies UIP
% - The smallest universe satisfies univalence
