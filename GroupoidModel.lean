-- This module serves as the root of the `GroupoidModelInLean4` library.

/- There should be at least three separate files here for three separate developments:
  1. the basic development of the category Grpd of groupoids
  2. the intermediate natural model of HoTT which is constructed out of Gpds
  3. the metaprogram level HoTT 0 for interacting with the model

# 1. The category Grpd of small groupoids
We will need at least the following:
  - discrete fibrations of groupoids
  - set-valued functors on groupoids (presheaves)
  - the Grothendieck construction relating the previous two
  - Œ£- and Œ†-types for discrete fibrations
  - path groupoids
  - the universe of (small) discrete groupoids
  - polynomial functors of groupoids
  - maybe some W-types

# 2. The natural model of HoTT in Grpd
We will need at least the following:
  - category Ctx of all small groupoids
  - the presheaf category ùìî = Psh(Ctx) in which the model lives
  - the presheaf Type : Ctx·µí·µñ ‚Üí Set of types in context
  - the presheaf Term : Ctx·µí·µñ ‚Üí Set of terms in context
  - the typing natural transformation t : Term ‚ü∂ Type
  - the proof that t is (re)presentable
  - the polynomial endofunctor P‚Çú : ùìî ‚•§ ùìî
  - the type-formers Œ£, Œ†, Id as operations on polynomials
  - the universe Set of (small) discrete groupoids,
      along with its discrete (op-)fibration Set* ‚ü∂ Set
  It might also be useful to have:
  - the proof that presentable natural transformations are tiny maps
  - the proof that P‚Çú is therefore cocontinuous, since t is tiny

# 3. HoTT 0
No idea!
But it would be nice if the user could:
- interact with types, terms, and type families rather than
    groupoids, homomorphisms, and fibrations
- have the usual Lean rules for the Œ£- and Œ†-types
- have path-induction for the general identity types
- define the sets as the 0-types
- use Lean's normal infrastructure like rewriting, tactics, mathlib, etc.
  for equality on sets.
